                    <h3>Personality</h3>
                    <p>According to rumors heard by Viktor, 
                        Scaramouche is not well-liked. 
                        Some say he has a disagreeable personality, 
                        being difficult to get along with, while others say 
                        he doesn't know when to keep his mouth shut. 
                        Even his fellow Harbingers appear to dislike him.
                        Presumably like the other Harbingers outside of Childe, 
                        Scaramouche tends to have an air of authority 
                        and arrogance to him, 
                        as he frequently insults others on a whim.
                        
                        As a Harbinger, Scaramouche is naturally 
                        a cunning individual. 
                        Possessing the wit and power to back him up, 
                        he is an unpredictable person.</p>

                    <h3>General Info</h3>
                    <p>Scaramouche, also known as Kunikuzushi (Japanese: 国崩 lit. "Country Destroyer")
                        or by his codename "Balladeer," is the Sixth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers 
                        and one of Genshin Impact's antagonists.
                        Scaramouche first appeared during the Unreconciled Stars event. 
                        He is encountered again in the Archon Quest Delusion during Chapter II 
                        and then again in the Archon Quest Dreams, Emptiness, Deception.</p>

            <h1>Pre-Fatui Story</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Scaramouche was originally created by Ei as a test 
                into the technology of making puppet bodies. <br>
                He was not meant to perfectly resemble her, 
                only to test if creating a puppet body was possible. <br>
                As his creation was successful, he was considered the prototype 
                for the puppet she now uses as the Raiden Shogun. <br>
                While he was intended to serve as a vessel for Ei's Gnosis, 
                he shed tears upon his creation, leading her to deem him 
                too gentle for such a task. <br>  She did not wish to kill him, 
                so she instead sealed his power as a divine creation 
                and allowed him to take control of his own life. <br>
                Despite Ei's benevolent intentions, however, 
                Scaramouche would come to see Ei's actions 
                as abandonment and betrayal. <br> Especially since he saw her 
                as not only his creator, but also his mother. 
                He spent his early days in Shakkei Pavilion.
                <br>
                <br>
                For a time, Scaramouche settled in Tatarasuna after Inspector Mikoshi 
                Nagamasa's yoriki, Katsuragi, found him in the pavilion. <br> Nagamasa's group 
                referred to him as the "wandering eccentric," as he had no name at the time. <br>
                Scaramouche grew close with Katsuragi and, after the forging of the 
                Daitatara Nagamasa, performed a sword dance with him. <br> Sometime later, 
                for reasons unknown, the group pursued Scaramouche but was unable to find him. <br>
                After learning of Katsuragi's "misconduct," which was likely related 
                to the reason they were searching for Scaramouche, Nagamasa flew into a rage 
                and slew Katsuragi. <br> This divided the group, who believed Nagamasa was 
                too obsessed with purity to understand Katsuragi's good intentions. <br>
                Scaramouche saw Nagamasa's actions as another betrayal. <br>
                Nagamasa and Scaramouche would later clash, with Nagamasa's fate afterwards left unknown.
                <br>
                <br>
                At some point after this, he befriended a young boy. <br>
                The boy made an unknown promise with him, but later died, breaking his promise. <br>
                Scaramouche considered this his life's third and final betrayal, and he began wandering across Inazuma. <br>
                Scaramouche also took on the name "Kunikuzushi." <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Kunikuzushi eventually chanced upon a group of Fatui. <br>
                Deciding they were interesting, he joined their ranks, wherein they unlocked the innate power he had as a creation of an Archon. <br>
                The Fatui also gave him some additional modifications, and eventually, he climbed to the position of The Balladeer, 
                the Sixth of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers. <br> It is unclear whether this occurred before or during the Case of the Eccentric, 
                which Kunikuzushi masterminded and the Fatui assisted in.
